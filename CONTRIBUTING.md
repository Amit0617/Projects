There are many ideas which can be templatised to use `.json` files as source of data (which the deployer can modify and make it personal.) and `fetch` can be used to place it at the right place in the website.  
Goal is simple it should be visually appealing, aesthetically pleasing and fully templatised.
There are many well known visually appealing projects and portfolios on the internet which are based on webGl, SVGs, parallax, scroll-based etc. which can be used as source of inspiration.
If you wanna create and contribute any such idea, you are welcomed to create a pull request in a new branch because this way anyone can choose exactly which template they wanna use (since github pages allow deployment on branch basis).
