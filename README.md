# Projects
My Projects, Your projects, Everyone else's Projects. A projects showcase for programmers who are busy on something more priority.
 ## GOAL
 It should be generalised and templatised completely, so that can be turned ON after forking and opting for hosting by GitHub. 
 
 ### Steps
 - [ ] Use GitHub api endpoint /{user}/repo.
 - [ ] Parse it, use Name(clickable with the link to that repo) and description in a card.
 - [ ] Cards with great bevel, small nice circular corners with appropriate light and shadows (experiment) with autorotation.
   - [ ] Fetching Images by link preview for social media preview to comeup as image would be a huge plus.
 - [ ] Scene(Background) should be matrix like floor.
 - [ ] 1 card should be visible at once. Next card should emerge with sideways scroll(arrows for next and previous cards).
 - [ ] GitHub Api is little conky, returns 30 repo in one request and may give different set of repos on different instances. So, to manage that and to make a predictable or a fixed response of website to various people configurable through internal .json file should be allowed.
